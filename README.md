# Natural Language Translator with OCR

A Flutter application that translates text using the Google Translation API and integrates Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images for translation.

This app combines real-time text translation and OCR capabilities, allowing users to scan images, extract text, and translate it into different languages. It uses the Google Cloud Translation API for text translation and a popular Flutter OCR plugin to extract text from images.

## Features

- **Real-time Text Translation**: Translate text between multiple languages.
- **Google Translate API**: Utilizes Google Cloud's Translation API for high accuracy and speed.
- **Multi-language Support**: Supports translation between a wide range of languages.
- **OCR Support**: Scan images, extract text, and translate the extracted text.
- **Simple and Intuitive UI**: Easy-to-use interface built with Flutter.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) - Version 3.x or above
- [Google Cloud API Key](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) - You'll need a valid Google Cloud API key for accessing the Google Translation API.
- Flutter plugin for OCR (e.g., [google_ml_kit](https://pub.dev/packages/google_ml_kit) or [firebase_ml_vision](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_ml_vision)).

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Clone this repo to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shailandra04/Natural_langauge_interpreter.git
Install Dependencies:

Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies using flutter pub get:

bash
Copy code
cd Natural_langauge_interpreter
flutter pub get
Set Up Google Cloud Translation API:

Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Create a new project (or select an existing one).
Enable the Cloud Translation API for your project.
Generate an API key and save it for use in the app.
Set Up Google Cloud Vision API for OCR:

In the Google Cloud Console, enable the Cloud Vision API for your project.
Generate a Vision API key and save it.
Configure the API Keys:

In your Flutter project, navigate to where you store your API keys (e.g., .env file or directly in your code) and add the following code snippet for both APIs:

dart
Copy code
final String translationApiKey = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_TRANSLATION_API_KEY';
final String visionApiKey = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY';
Run the App:

Once you have everything set up, run the app on your device or emulator:

bash
Copy code
flutter run
Usage
Text Translation:

Launch the app.
Enter the text to be translated.
Select the source and target languages from the dropdown.
The translated text will appear in the target language field.
OCR (Text from Image):

Launch the app.
Tap the "Scan Image" button to open the camera or select an image from your gallery.
The app will extract the text from the image using OCR.
Once the text is extracted, it will be displayed in the input field for translation.
Select the source and target languages and tap "Translate" to get the translated text.
Code Structure
lib/main.dart: Main entry point for the application. Initializes the app and handles both OCR and API communication.
lib/screens/home_screen.dart: Contains the UI for the app, including text fields, buttons, and language selectors.
lib/services/translation_service.dart: Handles all the logic for interacting with the Google Translate API.
lib/services/ocr_service.dart: Handles the OCR logic, using the Google Cloud Vision API or a Flutter OCR plugin to extract text from images.
Example of API Requests
Here are examples of the request formats for both the Google Translation API and the OCR process.

Google Translate API Request
dart
Copy code
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'dart:convert';

Future<String> translateText(String text, String targetLanguage) async {
  final String apiKey = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_TRANSLATION_API_KEY';
  final Uri url = Uri.https(
    'translation.googleapis.com',
    '/language/translate/v2',
    {
      'q': text,
      'target': targetLanguage,
      'key': apiKey,
    },
  );

  final response = await http.post(url);

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    var data = json.decode(response.body);
    return data['data']['translations'][0]['translatedText'];
  } else {
    throw Exception('Failed to translate text');
  }
}
OCR Request (Using Google ML Kit or Vision API)
Hereâ€™s a simple example using the google_ml_kit package for text recognition:

dart
Copy code
import 'package:google_ml_kit/google_ml_kit.dart';

Future<String> recognizeTextFromImage(XFile image) async {
  final textRecognizer = GoogleMlKit.vision.textRecognizer();
  final inputImage = InputImage.fromFilePath(image.path);
  final recognizedText = await textRecognizer.processImage(inputImage);

  String extractedText = recognizedText.text;
  return extractedText;
}
Troubleshooting
API Quotas: Both Google Translation and Vision APIs have usage limits. Ensure you check your quota on the Google Cloud Console.
Missing or Incorrect API Key: Double-check your API key configuration if you encounter errors related to authentication.
OCR Accuracy: OCR accuracy may vary depending on the quality of the image. Ensure good lighting and clear text for best results.

### Key Changes:
1. **OCR Added**: The `README.md` now mentions the **OCR functionality** and how it interacts with Google Cloud's Vision API.
2. **Code Examples**: Included examples of using the Google Translation API for translation and the `google_ml_kit` (or similar) package for OCR.
3. **Instructions for setting up both APIs**: Detailed steps for setting up the Google Cloud Translation and Vision APIs and generating API keys.

You can now add this `README.md` to your repository and modify it further as necessary. Let me
